## What is an "AI Bubble"?

A financial bubble occurs when prices or valuations rise far beyond the underlying fundamentals ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_bubble)).

In the context of AI, an "AI bubble" would imply that:
- Investor enthusiasm is inflated
- Company valuations exceed real productivity or profits
- Public hype outpaces actual capabilities

Google Trends can measure public interest or concern about an "AI bubble" via search volume. A surge in searches for "AI bubble" suggests many people are talking about or worrying about a possible bubble.

**First Principles**:
- If AI hype keeps growing → more bubble searches
- If hype fades or investors become cautious → searches level off or drop

## Analysis of Google Trends Data

### Nuanced Perspective

## Forecast: Will "AI Bubble" Searches Increase?

### Historical Pattern Analysis

In previous tech manias (crypto 2017, 2021), Google searches spiked right before bubble peaks ([Medium](https://medium.com/@mintonfin/altseason-signal-or-bubble-alarm-what-google-trends-memecoins-retail-fomo-are-telling-us-now-7e817799cb4e)):
- "How to buy bitcoin" searches → peak indicator
- "When the world starts Googling [something], early movers should start managing risk"

### Current Trajectory Analysis

**Supporting Continued Growth:**
- No clear sign of sharp downturn in data
- "AI startup" hit all-time high recently
- Major AI news continues (launches, IPOs, valuations)
- Media coverage self-reinforcing cycle
- Linear trend fit suggests climb to 40s by early 2026

**Potential Limiting Factors:**
- Deutsche Bank's "bubble in saying there's a bubble" observation
- Volatility in weekly data
- Possible plateau formation

### Mathematical Projection

- **Linear extrapolation**: Interest climbing to 40s by early 2026
- **Smoothing models**: Suggest potential plateau
- **Uncertainty**: High due to volatile nature of search interest

## Conclusion

### Primary Finding
Based on first-principles reasoning and data analysis:
- **70-80% probability** that "AI bubble" search interest will rise over next 6 months
- Strong current momentum in AI discussions and investments
- Unless major market shock occurs, searches likely to continue

### Are We in an AI Bubble?
- **Experts are divided** ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/opinions-split-over-ai-bubble-after-billions-invested-2025-10-16/), [Exploding Topics](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/ai-bubble))
- May only be clear in retrospect
- Continued increase in "AI bubble" searches means question remains very active

### Final Probability Assessment
**~75% probability that "AI bubble" search interest increases over the next six months**, given current evidence and assuming no abrupt market shock.
